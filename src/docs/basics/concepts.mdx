# Components

React uses components, which you can think of as your own re-usable "HTML tags".
For example you could write a `navbar.js` and `navbar-item.js` file and then use them in another
file:

```jsx
import Navbar from "./navbar.js"
import NavbarItem from "./navbar-item.js"

export default () => (
  <Navbar>
    <NavbarItem href="/">Home</NavbarItem>
    <NavbarItem href="/about">About</NavbarItem>
    <NavbarItem href="/contact">Contact</NavbarItem>
  </Navbar>
)
```

# Reactive

React is reactive, meaning **a change in a component's "state" triggers a re-render.**

Let's say you have a variable `counter` and you display that in your HTML (actually you're using JSX and not HTML, more about
that later) then every time the value of `counter` changes, the HTML where you used that variable in
re-renders to show the current value of the variable.

# Virtual DOM

Since changes to the DOM (Document Object Model, basically the "living form of your HTML" that contains all your HTML elements) are very
resource-expensive, React maintains a so-called "Virtual DOM", which is kind of a copy of the real
DOM. All changes are done to the virtual DOM at first. After changing the virtual DOM,
efficient method to make these changes to the real DOM is calculated and the real DOM is being updated.

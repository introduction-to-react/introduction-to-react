# create-react-app

create-react-app (often abbreviated as CRA) is an easy way to create new React app.
It does not only generate a new project using React for you, but also hides
lots of configuration from you (babel, webpack).

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

You can then cd into the directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-app
npm run start
```

# Project Structure

The following project was created for you:

```
my-app
├── node_modules
│   └── ...
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── logo192.png
│   ├── logo512.png
│   ├── manifest.json
│   └── robots.txt
├── README.md
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    ├── serviceWorker.js
    └── setupTests.js
```

- `node_modules`: contains the downloaded dependencies
- `package.json`: lists all your dependencies, contains some scripts and has meta information about
  your project like version and description
- `package-lock.json`: you shouldn't have to touch this file. It locks the versions of the dependencies you rely on
- `public`: contains files that will be directly served by the web server, like favicons,
  manifest.json, and assets (images, fonts) that you don't want to be process any further
- `README.md`: a simple readme will be generated for you, showing you how to run your project
- `src`: this is the folder you'll work in the most. It basically contains all your code, including JS and
  CSS

Let's take a look at the src files:

## src/index.js

```jsx
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import "./index.css"
import App from "./App"
import * as serviceWorker from "./serviceWorker"

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
)

serviceWorker.unregister()
```

You don't need to touch this file yet.

The interesting part, however, is the following:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```

This basically says "put our component `<App />` into the `#root` element".
The root element is the one found in the `public/index.html` file.

## src/App.js

```jsx
import React from "react" // imports React (needed in all components)
import logo from "./logo.svg" //imports an svg
import "./App.css" // loads the styles from App.css

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App // exports the component for use in other files
```

## Other files

- `index.css` contains overall styles, not related to a specific component; it is imported by the
  `index.js` file.
- `App.css` contains styles related to the `<App />` component; it is imported by the `App.js` file.
- `App.test.js` and `setupTests.js` are used for testing; you can delete them for now.
- `serviceWorker.js` isn't relevant right now either, it would allow you to make your web app a PWA
  (so you could make your app available offline etc.).
- `logo.svg` is a simple asset imported by our `<App />` component.

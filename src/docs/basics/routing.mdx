title: Routing with React Router

import Sandbox from "../../Sandbox.js"

React Router is a popular library used to handle Routing in React.

If you're using [Next](../next/routing), then you shouldn't need this, as Next provides its own (file-based) routing.

# Installation

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

# Example

<Sandbox example="react-router" />

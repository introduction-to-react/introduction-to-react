# JSX

JSX is a syntax extension used by React to create UI elements. You can kind of think of it as
"HTML tags within JS" (except they're actual JS elements). Its syntax doesn't differ a lot from
HTML, but there are a few exceptions like the following:

- HTML's `class` attribute becomes `className`
- HTML's `for` attribute becomes `htmlFor`
- and otherse

# Components and Props

[As introduced earlier](concepts#components), components are basically your self-written
custom "HTML tags" that you can re-use.
Every component usually gets their own file.
Typical components would be navbars, buttons, data pickers, color pickers and so on.
But also every route of your web app (like `/about` or `/contact`) will most likely get their own
file. Your components can also receive **props** from their parent component to allow them to be
more flexible.

## Example component

```jsx title=navbar-item.js
import React from "react"

const NavBarItem = (props) => (
  <a style={{ color: props.color, marginRight: "5px" }} href={props.href}>
    {props.children}
  </a>
)

export default NavbarItem
```

As you can see, the component is just an exported function that receives a `props` object.
To use a JS expression (like a variable) within JSX, you have to put that expression within `{ }`.
`props.children` contains the element's children (Example: `<b>Here are the b tag's children</b>`)

You can the import the component in another file and use it:

```jsx title=App.js
import React from "react"
import NavbarItem from "./components/navbar-item"

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <NavbarItem href="/" color="blue">
      Home
    </NavbarItem>
    <NavbarItem href="/about" color="red">
      about
    </NavbarItem>
    <NavbarItem href="/contact" color="green">
      contact
    </NavbarItem>
  </div>
)

export default App
```

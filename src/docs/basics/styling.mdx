# External stylesheets

You can just create an external stylesheet and import it in your application the
following way:

`index.js:`

```js
import "./styles.css"
```

# Inline styles

In CSS, propierties use kebab-case (e.g. `font-size`).
In JS, camelCase is used (e.g. `fontSize`).

```jsx
// Numbers (not string) are automically understood as pixels
// You can also use JS variables; as you can see, the color is set to
// theme.color.primary here. If the value of it changes, the styling will
// adjust too
<div style={{width: '100%', height: 200, fontSize=16, color: theme.color.primary}}>
</div>

// Always applies the my-div-style class
// When the variable isDarkMode is set to true, the class dark-mode is added,
// otherwise the class light-mode is used
<div className={`my-div-style ${isDarkMode ? "dark-mode" : "light-mode" }`}>
</div>
```

# CSS-in-JS

Another common approach is to use CSS within JS.
This allows you to easily create dynamic styles and style your components based
on JS logic.

[styled-jsx](advanced/styled-jsx) is one common library for CSS-in-JS.

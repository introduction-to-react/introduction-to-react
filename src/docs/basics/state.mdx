title: State and Two-Way Data Binding
---

import Sandbox from "../../Sandbox.js"

Components can have a state, which are variables that belong to the component and
[are reactive](concepts#reactive). When you use those variables in your component and that
variable's value changes, your component re-renders to show the current value.

# Example

```jsx highlight={4,8,11}
import React, { useState } from "react"

export default () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setCount(count + 1)
        }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

As you can see, we can receive a new state variable and setter for the variable by using the `useState()` [hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and tell
it its initial value.
Whenever you want to change the variables value, you **have to use its setter**.

Also, as you can see, React allows you to pass the `<button>` a function that will be executed when
you click on it.

# Two-way binding (binding state to input)

<Sandbox example="two-way-data-binding" />

You can simply bind the value of `text` to the value attribute from the `<input>` element.
Whenever the input's value changes, the function passed to `onChange` will be executed and receive
the new value.
Now, in `handleChange()`, we set the new value the setter.

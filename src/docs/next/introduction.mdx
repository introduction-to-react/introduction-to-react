title: Introduction to Next.js
---

Next.js is a framework for React (yep, a framework for a framework) and
simplifies React development, but also adds new features that are fairly easy
to use:

- Internationalization
- Image Optimization
- Analytics
- Less configuration
- SSR and SSG
- File-based routing
- Built-in component-scoped styling and SASS support
- Create API endpoint for backend functionality

# Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Before sending the website to the browser, it gets prerender on the server.
This has the following advantages:

- Better Search Engine Optimization
- Servers are faster than client's browser -> faster loading
- dynamic html meta tags, for example for [structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data#:~:text=Structured%20data%20is%20a%20standardized,the%20calories%2C%20and%20so%20on.)

# Static Site Generation (SSG)

When running in SSG mode, static sites are output, so you don't need a
server running.

Unlike normal SPAs like when using normal React, however, the sites are
delivered empty to the user. Instead, the HTML is delivered pre-prerendered
to the user

- Lower costs
- Easy deployments to CDNS
- Better SEO and performance than non-pre-rendered SPAs

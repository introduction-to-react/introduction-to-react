title: HTTP Requests using Axios
---

Axios is one of several ways of making HTTP requests.
Other popular alternatives are the Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest.

To install it, simply run `npm install axios`. You can then import it using `import axios from 'axios';`

# GET request

```js
import axios from "axios"

async function myFunc() {
  try {
    // this will become https://some-api.com/?search=how%20to%20use%20axios
    const reponse = await axios.get("https://some-api.com/", {
      params: {
        search: "how to use axios",
      },
    })
    console.log(reponse)
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error)
  }
}
```

# POST request

```js
import axios from "axios"

async function myFunc() {
  try {
    const reponse = await axios.post("https://some-api.com/", {
      //this is the request's body
      name: "Michael",
    })
    console.log(reponse)
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error)
  }
}
```

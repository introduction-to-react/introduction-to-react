This is an opinionated introduction to React and some of the technologies often used with React.

# Why use a JS framework?

JavaScript frameworks make it easier to develop and scale projects since they provide lots of
convenient helpers like data binding (for example binding a variable to a text input) and structuring your application into components.

# Current JS frameworks

## React.js

React is developed by Facebook and very widely used. You'll also find tons of ready-to-use components on the web.

### Next.js

Next.js builds upon React.js and enables server-side rendering or static site generation for better
performance and SEO.
It also abstracts some of the logic further away; for example, it uses file-based routing.

## Vue.js

Vue.js is another popular JS framework; its popularity rose quickly and it might be considered
easier to get started with compared to React and Angular.

## Angular

Angular is being developed by Google and is heavily used for enterprise applications.

## Svelte

Svelte is rather new and easy to learn. You don't need to write as much boilerplate as with other
frameworks and it doesn't use a virtual DOM.

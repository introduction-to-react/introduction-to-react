# Modern JavaScript

JavaScript is being developed actively and gets frequent additions.

## let/const

`let` and `const` were introduced in ECMAScript2015 (ES6) and are a new way to declare variables.
You should avoid `var` when possible, since `var` declare global variables.

Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped and `const` variables are final, so their value can't
be changed.

## Arrow functions

## async/await
